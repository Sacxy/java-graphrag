# 🧠 Intelligent Code Query System: Agentic Architecture Design

## 🎯 Vision
Transform the current noisy, complex system into an intelligent, focused architecture where specialized tools work together under an adaptive orchestrator to answer code queries effectively.

## 🏗️ Core Philosophy

### From Chaos to Clarity
**Current State**: 
- Multiple overlapping agents creating noise
- Complex chains with unclear responsibilities  
- All entities sent to LLM (expensive & slow)
- No clear strategy selection

**Target State**:
- 6 focused tools with clear purposes
- Intelligent orchestrator managing execution
- Selective LLM usage for synthesis only
- Adaptive strategy based on query understanding

### Guiding Principles (Learned from Industry Best Practices)

#### 1. **Simplicity First** (Anthropic)
- Start with the simplest solution that works
- Only add complexity when demonstrably necessary
- Avoid over-engineering

#### 2. **Structured Outputs Over Magic** (12-Factor)
- Convert natural language to structured JSON decisions
- Tools are just structured output handlers
- Separate decision-making from execution

#### 3. **Transparency and Explainability** (Anthropic)
- Make agent reasoning visible
- Show planning steps explicitly
- Enable debugging through clear decision trails

#### 4. **Stateless Design** (12-Factor)
- Agents as pure functions: (State, Input) → (NewState, Actions)
- External state management
- Enables testing, scaling, and reproducibility

#### 5. **Human-in-the-Loop as First-Class** (12-Factor)
- Design for human collaboration from the start
- Support pause/resume workflows
- Enable approvals and interventions

#### 6. **Own Your Stack** (12-Factor)
- Hand-craft prompts as versioned infrastructure
- Control your context window explicitly
- Implement business logic in code, not prompts

## 🤖 The Intelligent Orchestrator Agent

### Core Responsibilities
The orchestrator is not just a router - it's an intelligent agent that:
1. **Understands** - Deeply analyzes queries to extract intent
2. **Plans** - Creates multi-step execution strategies
3. **Executes** - Runs tools with proper sequencing
4. **Learns** - Adapts based on results
5. **Iterates** - Refines approach until satisfied
6. **Explains** - Provides reasoning for decisions

## 🔄 Tool Response Feedback Loop

### Core Concept
The orchestrator receives tool responses and makes intelligent decisions about next steps. Each tool response feeds back into the orchestrator's decision-making process.

### Feedback Loop Architecture

```
ToolFeedbackLoop:
├── Response Analysis
│   ├── ResultCompleteness           # Is the answer complete?
│   ├── ConfidenceAssessment         # How confident are we?
│   ├── GapIdentification            # What's missing?
│   └── QualityEvaluation            # Is quality sufficient?
│
├── Decision Engine
│   ├── ContinuationDecider          # Should we continue?
│   ├── ToolSelector                 # What tool next?
│   ├── RefinementPlanner            # How to improve results?
│   └── TerminationChecker           # When to stop?
│
├── Context Evolution
│   ├── ResultAggregation            # Combine tool outputs
│   ├── ContextEnrichment            # Add new information
│   ├── PruningStrategy              # Remove redundant data
│   └── FocusRefinement              # Narrow down scope
│
└── Iteration Control
    ├── IterationCounter             # Track attempts
    ├── ImprovementTracker           # Are we improving?
    ├── CircuitBreaker               # Prevent infinite loops
    └── CostCalculator               # Resource usage
```

### Tool Response Processing (Stateless Reducer Pattern)

```java
public class ToolResponseProcessor {
    
    // Stateless reducer: (State, Input) -> (NewState, Actions)
    public ExecutionStepResult processToolResponse(
        ExecutionState currentState,
        ToolResponse response,
        ExecutionContext context
    ) {
        // 1. Analyze the response (structured)
        ResponseAnalysis analysis = analyzeResponse(response, currentState.getIntent());
        
        // 2. Create new state (immutable)
        ExecutionState newState = currentState.toBuilder()
            .addToolResult(response)
            .updateKnowledge(response.getDiscoveredEntities())
            .updateConfidence(analysis.getConfidence())
            .incrementToolCallCount()
            .build();
        
        // 3. Determine next actions (explicit control flow)
        List<NextAction> actions = determineNextActions(analysis, newState);
        
        // 4. Check for human interaction needs
        if (analysis.needsHumanInput()) {
            actions.add(NextAction.REQUEST_HUMAN_INPUT(
                analysis.getHumanInteractionType(),
                analysis.getHumanPrompt()
            ));
        }
        
        // 5. Apply circuit breaker logic
        if (newState.getToolCallCount() > MAX_TOOL_CALLS) {
            actions.add(NextAction.ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN("Too many tool calls"));
        }
        
        return ExecutionStepResult.builder()
            .newState(newState)
            .actions(actions)
            .explanation(analysis.getExplanation())
            .confidence(analysis.getConfidence())
            .build();
    }
    
    // Structured decision making
    private List<NextAction> determineNextActions(ResponseAnalysis analysis, ExecutionState state) {
        return switch (analysis.getCompletionStatus()) {
            case COMPLETE_HIGH_CONFIDENCE -> List.of(NextAction.PROCEED_TO_SYNTHESIS);
            case COMPLETE_LOW_CONFIDENCE -> List.of(NextAction.REQUEST_VALIDATION);
            case PARTIAL_WITH_GAPS -> List.of(NextAction.CALL_TOOL(selectNextTool(analysis.getGaps())));
            case NEEDS_REFINEMENT -> List.of(NextAction.REFINE_WITH_TOOL(selectRefinementTool()));
            case REQUIRES_HUMAN_INPUT -> List.of(NextAction.PAUSE_FOR_HUMAN(analysis.getHumanPrompt()));
            case FAILED -> List.of(NextAction.TRY_ALTERNATIVE_STRATEGY);
        };
    }
}
```

### Decision Points After Each Tool

```
After Semantic Code Hunter:
├── Found entities? → Explore structure
├── No matches? → Try fuzzy search or rephrase
├── Too many matches? → Add context enrichment
└── Partial matches? → Expand search scope

After Structural Explorer:
├── Complex graph? → Focus on critical paths
├── Missing connections? → Use path tracer
├── Patterns detected? → Enrich with context
└── Anomalies found? → Deep dive with tracer

After Path Tracer:
├── Complex flows? → Simplify with narrative
├── Missing paths? → Expand exploration
├── Performance issues? → Add profiling
└── Complete trace? → Generate narrative

After Context Enricher:
├── Sufficient context? → Generate narrative
├── Missing docs? → Try semantic search
├── Quality issues? → Use different sources
└── Rich context? → Proceed to synthesis

After Narrative Generator:
├── Clear story? → Return to user
├── Confusing parts? → Add more context
├── Missing details? → Re-run specific tools
└── Multiple perspectives? → Combine narratives
```

## 📊 Context Window Management

### The Challenge
As the orchestrator calls multiple tools, data accumulates:
- Tool responses can be large (graphs, traces, context)
- Multiple iterations compound the problem
- LLM context windows have hard limits
- Important information must be preserved

### Context Management Architecture

```
ContextWindowManager:
├── Context Tracking
│   ├── TokenCounter                 # Track usage
│   ├── WindowMonitor                # Current utilization
│   ├── PriorityTracker              # What's important
│   └── HistoryManager               # What to keep
│
├── Compression Strategies
│   ├── Summarization                # Condense verbose content
│   ├── Deduplication                # Remove redundancy

│   ├── ConfidenceRanking            # Keep high-confidence data
│   └── DependencyAnalysis           # Keep critical connections
│
└── Storage Strategies
    ├── ActiveContext                # In current window
    ├── NearContext                  # Quickly retrievable
    ├── ArchiveContext               # Stored for reference
    └── SummaryContext               # Compressed versions
```

### Context Window Strategies

#### 1. **Progressive Summarization**
```java
public class ProgressiveSummarizer {
    public CompressedContext compress(ToolResponse response, int targetTokens) {
        return CompressedContext.builder()
            .essentialFacts(extractKeyFacts(response))      // Critical info
            .summary(generateSummary(response, targetTokens)) // Condensed version
            .references(storeFullVersion(response))          // Where to find details
            .confidence(calculateCompressionLoss(response))   // Quality measure
            .build();
    }
}
```

#### 2. **Sliding Window with Importance**
```
Window Management:
├── Keep Always (High Priority)
│   ├── User query
│   ├── Current tool results
│   ├── Key entities found
│   └── Critical decisions made
│
├── Keep if Space (Medium Priority)
│   ├── Previous tool summaries
│   ├── Intermediate results
│   ├── Supporting evidence
│   └── Alternative paths
│
└── Compress/Archive (Low Priority)
    ├── Detailed traces
    ├── Full graph data
    ├── Redundant information
    └── Failed attempts
```

#### 3. **Smart Context Pruning**
```java
public class ContextPruner {
    public ExecutionContext prune(ExecutionContext context, int maxTokens) {
        // 1. Calculate importance scores
        Map<ContextItem, Double> scores = calculateImportance(context);
        
        // 2. Keep essential items
        Set<ContextItem> essential = getEssentialItems(context);
        
        // 3. Compress large items
        Map<ContextItem, CompressedItem> compressed = compressLargeItems(context);
        
        // 4. Build pruned context within token limit
        return buildPrunedContext(essential, compressed, scores, maxTokens);
    }
}
```

### Token Budget Allocation

```
Total Context Window: 200K tokens (Claude-3)

Allocation Strategy:
├── System Prompts: 5K (2.5%)
├── User Query & History: 10K (5%)
├── Active Tool Results: 50K (25%)
├── Summarized History: 30K (15%)
├── Code Snippets & Context: 80K (40%)
├── Working Memory: 20K (10%)
└── Buffer/Overhead: 5K (2.5%)

Dynamic Reallocation:
- If code heavy → Reduce summaries
- If exploration heavy → Reduce snippets
- If synthesis phase → Maximize context
```

### Context Compression Techniques

#### 1. **Entity Reference System**
Instead of repeating full entity details:
```java
// First mention
Entity: {
    id: "e1",
    type: "Method",
    name: "processPayment",
    class: "PaymentService",
    package: "com.example.payment",
    signature: "public Result processPayment(Payment p)",
    // ... full details
}

// Subsequent mentions
EntityRef: "e1"  // Just reference ID
```

#### 2. **Graph Summarization**
```java
// Instead of full graph
FullGraph: {
    nodes: [500 nodes with full details],
    edges: [2000 edges with metadata]
}

// Compressed representation
GraphSummary: {
    nodeCount: 500,
    edgeCount: 2000,
    keyNodes: [top 10 most connected],
    patterns: ["Facade pattern detected", "Circular dependency: A->B->C->A"],
    clusters: [5 main clusters with descriptions],
    focusSubgraph: [relevant 20 nodes, 50 edges]
}
```

#### 3. **Incremental Updates**
```java
// Instead of full state each time
InitialState: { full details }

// Then just deltas
Update1: { added: [...], modified: [...], removed: [...] }
Update2: { added: [...], modified: [...], removed: [...] }
```

### Adaptive Context Management

```java
public class AdaptiveContextManager {
    
    public void manageContext(ExecutionContext context, ToolResponse newResponse) {
        // 1. Measure current usage
        int currentTokens = tokenCounter.count(context);
        int responseTokens = tokenCounter.count(newResponse);
        
        // 2. Predict future needs
        int predictedNeeds = predictFutureTokenNeeds(context.getStrategy());
        
        // 3. Make space if needed
        if (currentTokens + responseTokens + predictedNeeds > MAX_TOKENS) {
            // Compress oldest/least relevant
            compressOldResults(context);
            
            // Summarize intermediate results
            summarizeIntermediateState(context);
            
            // Archive detailed data
            archiveDetails(context);
        }
        
        // 4. Add new response intelligently
        if (isHighValue(newResponse)) {
            context.addFullResponse(newResponse);
        } else {
            context.addCompressedResponse(compress(newResponse));
        }
    }
}
```

### Context Window Optimization Patterns

#### 1. **Phased Execution**
```
Phase 1: Discovery (High Context)
- Keep all search results
- Maintain entity details
- Store relationships

Phase 2: Analysis (Moderate Context)  
- Compress search results
- Keep key entities only
- Focus on relevant paths

Phase 3: Synthesis (Optimized Context)
- Minimal tool results
- Maximum code context
- Rich narrative space
```

#### 2. **Context Recycling**
```java
// Reuse context across similar queries
ContextCache: {
    "payment_flow": { cached context for payment queries },
    "auth_system": { cached context for auth queries },
    "user_service": { cached context for user queries }
}

// Quick warm start for related queries
if (similarQueryExists(query)) {
    context = loadCachedContext(query);
    context.updateWithNewQuery(query);
}
```

```

### Context Evolution Through Iterations

```

- User query
- Intent analysis
- 15 discovered methods
- Search metadata

After Iteration 3 (45K tokens):
- User query
- Intent analysis

- Archived: Full traces, detailed graphs

Final Context for Synthesis (50K tokens):
- Query + all summaries
- Key code snippets
- Essential relationships
- Business context
- Ready for narrative generation
```

## 🛠️ The 6 Tools - Refined Design (Production-Ready)

### Design Principles for Tools
1. **Stateless**: Each tool is a pure function
2. **Structured I/O**: Clear request/response schemas
3. **Bounded Execution**: Time limits and resource constraints
4. **Confidence Scoring**: All outputs include confidence
5. **Explanation**: Tools explain their reasoning
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with recovery suggestions

### 🔍 Tool 1: Semantic Code Hunter (Enhanced)

**Purpose**: Convert natural language queries into structured code entity searches

**Key Improvements:**
- **Structured Intent Processing**: Process structured intents, not raw queries
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each match includes calibrated confidence
- **Multi-Modal Search**: Combines embeddings + keywords + structure
- **Context Awareness**: Uses previous search results to refine
- **Explanation Generation**: Why each result matches
- **Bounded Execution**: Time and result limits

**Request Structure (Structured Input):**
```json
{
  "intent": {
    "type": "FIND_CODE_ENTITIES",
    "entities": ["payment", "processing", "validation"],
    "entityTypes": ["METHOD", "CLASS"],
    "confidence": 0.85
  },
  "searchMode": "PRECISE",           // PRECISE, FUZZY, EXPLORATORY
  "previousResults": ["entity123"],  // For refinement
  "excludePatterns": ["*Test*"],     // What to skip
